Okay. Interesting. Are we meant to be doing this collaboratively?</p><p>B: Yes.</p><p>A: Got you. Okay, we’ve both seen this picture before.</p><p>B: Yes.</p><p>A: And what’s interesting here is it says that the events are tied black path back. But I do see some events tied to the red path as well.</p><p>B: Like where at the very start, the.</p><p>A: Cossacks pass the demon out of Caliph.</p><p>B: Like <a data-attr="17" class="action">this part</a>?</p><p>A: Yeah, that part. That’s the. Okay.</p><p>B: So that’s the Russians. I’m not sure, but I don’t know.</p><p>A: I’m now going <a data-attr="18" class="action">ahead</a> and reading the text. Do I need more historical information in my brain?</p><p>B: I mean, I think we can figure out some of what’s going on, right? There’s some major things, like where <a data-attr="19" class="action">the two armies meet up with each other</a> that divided.</p><p>A: So I see a <a data-attr="20" class="action">division here</a> where someone goes off <a data-attr="21" class="action">force there</a>.</p><p>B: Yeah. What’s interesting is I don’t know how long <a data-attr="22" class="action">this part</a> took, but it seems to have taken just as long as <a data-attr="23" class="action">this entire part</a>.</p><p>A: Yeah. So <a data-attr="24" class="action">where did they go</a>? <a data-attr="25" class="action">Here</a>. They had also <a data-attr="26" class="action">diminishing</a> numbers, probably similar to. Okay, interesting. So there’s <a data-attr="27" class="action">numbers here</a>.</p><p>B: Wait, that’s a number. I thought that was <a data-attr="28" class="action">population count</a>. Okay.</p><p>A: Yeah. You need a 4k monitor.</p><p>B: Yeah, I don’t have a very big monitor.</p><p>A: Okay, so <a data-attr="29" class="action">400,000 here</a>. Where <a data-attr="30" class="action">75,000</a>.</p><p>B: I see.</p><p>A: And over here, this branch <a data-attr="31" class="action">offset of 60,000</a>, ends up with <a data-attr="32" class="action">33,000 here</a>.</p><p>B: Okay.</p><p>A: 30,000 <a data-attr="33" class="action">here</a>. When they’re going to meet up again. At that point, it looks like they add with <a data-attr="34" class="action">the 20,000</a> to get to <a data-attr="35" class="action">the 50,000</a>.</p><p>B: Yeah. So are they just hanging out <a data-attr="36" class="action">here</a> for a while?</p><p>A: Just hanging out <a data-attr="37" class="action">there</a> and not dying as much as <a data-attr="38" class="action">everybody else</a>?</p><p>B: I guess so.</p><p>A: That’s right. Okay. Was there actual incursions with russian forces during any of this, or is <a data-attr="39" class="action">this</a> just weather?</p><p>B: Yeah, I don’t know.</p><p>A: In order to better judge the eye on the <a data-attr="40" class="action">diminishion</a> of the army troops, which rover <a data-attr="41" class="action">Marshall devotee</a> who had been detached at Minsk.</p><p>B: Okay, so this is a little bit of a lie. So the fact that <a data-attr="42" class="action">everybody starts together</a> is like a simplifying assumption.</p><p>A: I see. All right, so <a data-attr="43" class="action">the names here</a>, <a data-attr="44" class="action">those</a> are like locations?</p><p>B: I think so.</p><p>A: And then <a data-attr="45" class="action">down here</a> we’ve got how darn cold it’s getting.</p><p>B: But only <a data-attr="46" class="action">on the way back</a>.</p><p>A: Interesting. Right. But only on the way back. So they started recording it, but started showing at about <a data-attr="47" class="action">freezing level</a>. Yeah, <a data-attr="48" class="action">10,000</a> make it back out of the <a data-attr="49" class="action">422,000</a> that started.</p><p>B: Oh, that’s so wrong.</p><p>A: Yeah. And they got to <a data-attr="50" class="action">Moscow</a> at 100,000. But of course, there was <a data-attr="51" class="action">this other horse</a> at 30,000. And the river crossings seem to be shown mostly at just <a data-attr="52" class="action">the return</a> except for <a data-attr="53" class="action">the Neiman</a>.</p><p>B: And what’s neat is you can see <a data-attr="54" class="action">the effect</a> of having to forward the river. How <a data-attr="55" class="action">there’s a discontinuity</a>.</p><p>A: We lose 4000 down to getting down to <a data-attr="56" class="action">20,000</a> <a data-attr="57" class="action">here</a>. <a data-attr="58" class="action">Same with here</a>. They go from <a data-attr="59" class="action">50,000 to 28,000</a>.</p><p>B: But this one, there’s <a data-attr="60" class="action">this discontinuity here</a>. But it’s like before the river.</p><p>A: Interesting. Maybe that’s when they <a data-attr="61" class="action">waited</a> and thought that.</p><p>B: I mean, there is also a <a data-attr="62" class="action">discontinuity</a> <a data-attr="63" class="action">here</a>. <a data-attr="64" class="action">Here</a>. <a data-attr="65" class="action">Discretization</a> of the data as well.</p><p>A: These do seem to be <a data-attr="66" class="action">inclining</a>.</p><p>B: But there’s also these here, which strike me as polling because there are <a data-attr="67" class="action">no rivers here</a>. But notice that they have the temperature <a data-attr="68" class="action">here</a> and <a data-attr="69" class="action">here</a>. Until they knew.</p><p>A: I didn’t see where you were showing <a data-attr="70" class="action">the temperatures</a>.</p><p>B: This <a data-attr="71" class="action">temperature</a>. See this one mine goes up <a data-attr="72" class="action">here</a> and there’s a discontinuity right <a data-attr="73" class="action">here</a>. Because I think he knows <a data-attr="74" class="action">the number</a> <a data-attr="75" class="action">somewhere</a> <a data-attr="76" class="action">over here</a>. And he knows <a data-attr="77" class="action">the number</a> somewhere <a data-attr="78" class="action">over here</a>. And then that creates <a data-attr="79" class="action">discontinuity</a>.</p><p>A: Yeah, I see. I wonder if that is tied to when they have historical record of <a data-attr="80" class="action">the actual temperature</a>.</p><p>B: Well, it says it’s based on <a data-attr="81" class="action">the diary of Jacob</a>, the.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="82" class="action">Okay, I see.</a> So maybe like Jacob wrote down the temperatures on <a data-attr="83" class="action">those days</a>. Yeah, and then the troop sizes <a data-attr="84" class="action">somewhere in the middle</a>.</p><p>B: No, I think they just <a data-attr="85" class="action">labeled</a> them like that. But I’m guessing on <a data-attr="86" class="action">these same dates</a> he guessed what <a data-attr="87" class="action">the</a>.</p><p>A: Okay, that makes more sense.</p><p>B: I also think the numbers are very.</p><p>A: Yeah, I got you. So it probably doesn’t really matter.</p><p>B: So maybe even though he doesn’t report the temperature <a data-attr="88" class="action">here</a>, he reports the troop count and the fact that they cross <a data-attr="89" class="action">the river Richmond</a>.</p><p>A: I didn’t see your.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="90" class="action">Here</a>.</p><p>A: Okay, got you.</p><p>B: So there’s no temperature <a data-attr="91" class="action">here</a>. So maybe he just reported that they <a data-attr="92" class="action">crossed the river</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="93" class="action">Yeah, I see.</a> Oh, interesting. So <a data-attr="94" class="action">those two troops</a>, <a data-attr="95" class="action">30,000</a> <a data-attr="96" class="action">here</a>, <a data-attr="97" class="action">100,000</a> from here, they’re <a data-attr="98" class="action">down to 4000</a> <a data-attr="99" class="action">here</a>. But they meet up with another 22,000 that come down as 6000 in <a data-attr="100" class="action">the very beginning</a>.</p><p>B: I think <a data-attr="101" class="action">these</a> must not be at <a data-attr="102" class="action">the same time</a>. I think it’s just <a data-attr="103" class="action">like</a>, they can’t eat due <a data-attr="104" class="action">time</a> on this, so they make it look like it’s <a data-attr="105" class="action">the same amount</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="106" class="action">Okay.</a></p><p>B: They’re coming back to <a data-attr="107" class="action">the same time</a>.</p><p>A: The return trip seems to be <a data-attr="108" class="action">time based</a>, though, <a data-attr="109" class="action">right</a>?</p><p>B: Right. But not <a data-attr="110" class="action">this offshoot</a> or <a data-attr="111" class="action">this offshoot</a>.</p><p>A: Yeah, <a data-attr="112" class="action">the black one</a>.</p><p>B: Okay.</p><p>A: Yeah. Who knows what they were doing <a data-attr="113" class="action">up here</a> having a commune. Anyway, we spent, like, ten minutes. How do we have time? All of them?</p><p>B: Yes, but the next few are not too bad.</p><p>A: Okay.</p><p>B: All right. Okay, part two. There are five maps showing different us cities segregation conditions. Here, one dot represents 120 people. Different ethical groups are colored in different colors. Your task, one for each map, identify any patterns in how neighborhoods are desegregated. Two, compare different cities. What similarities and differences do you notice in the patterns of the segregation? Discuss other findings. I think so this is a case where we can switch between the different cities.</p><p>A: Oh, I see. Okay, so the five maps, these next five digitalization, are related to this construction.</p><p>B: And we can always bug out early once there’s enough data.</p><p>A: Yeah. Okay.</p><p>B: All right.</p><p>A: All right. So first notices here is like, <a data-attr="114" class="action">Manhattan</a> seems to have a lot of population.</p><p>B: It’s very dense. And then Central park. Nobody lives in <a data-attr="115" class="action">Central park</a> according to this data.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="116" class="action">That makes sense</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="117" class="action">I don’t think that’s actually true.</a> <a data-attr="118" class="action">Each dot represents</a>, like, <a data-attr="119" class="action">100 people</a>. <a data-attr="120" class="action">Does it say that?</a> <a data-attr="121" class="action">I can’t actually</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="122" class="action">Can you zoom in</a>?</p><p>B: This, like, <a data-attr="123" class="action">control</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="124" class="action">Okay.</a></p><p>B: There are other places that are <a data-attr="125" class="action">missing population</a>, like <a data-attr="126" class="action">this thing</a>, and I don’t know whether <a data-attr="127" class="action">that’s</a>.</p><p>A: Unfortunately, your pointer color is very light colored, <a data-attr="128" class="action">very light cyan</a>. So I cannot <a data-attr="129" class="action">see it</a> at all.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="130" class="action">Okay</a>. Do you want me to. How does <a data-attr="131" class="action">this</a> look?</p><p>A: Oh, hey, how did you make it <a data-attr="132" class="action">thicker</a>?</p><p>B: I’m using <a data-attr="133" class="action">the pen</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="134" class="action">Nice</a>.</p><p>B: Okay. <a data-attr="135" class="action">This area</a>, I don’t think that’s <a data-attr="136" class="action">a park</a>, but it might be an <a data-attr="137" class="action">industrial zone</a>. It’s <a data-attr="138" class="action">an idea</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="139" class="action">Yeah, that makes sense.</a> Okay. There does seem to be a lot of <a data-attr="140" class="action">stratification for ethnic groups</a>, <a data-attr="141" class="action">except for</a>, <a data-attr="142" class="action">like</a>, in <a data-attr="143" class="action">Jersey City</a>, there’s <a data-attr="144" class="action">a couple</a> with <a data-attr="145" class="action">a few mixings</a>, but getting kind of the sense that it might be hard to tell from <a data-attr="146" class="action">the colors</a>. It seems like there’s more <a data-attr="147" class="action">stratification</a> between <a data-attr="148" class="action">black ethnic group</a> and everybody else. But it might be that it’s hard to distinguish <a data-attr="149" class="action">blue</a> from <a data-attr="150" class="action">green</a>.</p><p>B: I think <a data-attr="151" class="action">the blue and the green</a> look pretty different, except, like, I guess <a data-attr="152" class="action">over here</a> you can see there’s, like, a bunch of green in the middle of <a data-attr="153" class="action">this blue area</a>.</p><p>A: Interesting. I can’t read what it <a data-attr="154" class="action">says</a>, though. Even on <a data-attr="155" class="action">my monitor</a>.</p><p>B: I’m not too familiar with <a data-attr="156" class="action">New York</a>. You want to try <a data-attr="157" class="action">different cities</a>?</p><p>A: <a data-attr="158" class="action">Yep.</a></p><p>B: All right, so <a data-attr="159" class="action">the next one</a> is Chicago, which I’m also not very familiar with.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="160" class="action">A very sharp divide</a>, <a data-attr="161" class="action">north</a> <a data-attr="162" class="action">south</a> shorelines.</p><p>B: What is <a data-attr="163" class="action">that shoreline</a>? Yeah, this is <a data-attr="164" class="action">the lake</a> <a data-attr="165" class="action">here</a>, sort of <a data-attr="166" class="action">river</a>.</p><p>A: This is <a data-attr="167" class="action">the big lake</a>.</p><p>B: Okay, so you’re saying <a data-attr="168" class="action">right here</a> is where there’s a <a data-attr="169" class="action">north south divide</a>, but then there’s <a data-attr="170" class="action">also</a>, like, <a data-attr="171" class="action">this area</a> and <a data-attr="172" class="action">this area</a> I can’t see.</p><p>A: Again. Can I see <a data-attr="173" class="action">your pointer</a>? Can you draw <a data-attr="174" class="action">the lake</a> so I can see your pen?</p><p>B: All right, <a data-attr="175" class="action">here’s my</a>.</p><p>A: Probably because you’re <a data-attr="176" class="action">drawing on your screen</a>.</p><p>B: What do you mean <a data-attr="177" class="action">drawing on my screen</a>?</p><p>A: How is your pen <a data-attr="178" class="action">changing thickness</a>? Just.</p><p>B: I’m <a data-attr="179" class="action">pressing</a> with the mouse more.</p><p>A: Do that. I guess it changes thickness when I go <a data-attr="180" class="action">slow</a>. <a data-attr="181" class="action">Okay</a>. If I go slow, then I get a <a data-attr="182" class="action">slow pen movement</a>. But now I can’t see your <a data-attr="183" class="action">pointer</a> or <a data-attr="184" class="action">pen</a> at all.</p><p>B: I’m not <a data-attr="185" class="action">pressing down</a> or anything.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="186" class="action">Okay.</a></p><p>B: <a data-attr="187" class="action">Can you draw?</a> <a data-attr="188" class="action">Here</a>’s my pointer.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="189" class="action">Okay.</a> Yeah. It’s very thin and <a data-attr="190" class="action">light green colored</a>.</p><p>B: Okay, so <a data-attr="191" class="action">light green</a> is a bad color is what you’re telling me.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="192" class="action">Yeah</a>. So interestingly, when I use <a data-attr="193" class="action">the laser pointer</a>, I get a <a data-attr="194" class="action">nice blue</a> that’s <a data-attr="195" class="action">very dark</a>.</p><p>B: So do I on <a data-attr="196" class="action">mine</a>.</p><p>A: Okay. And <a data-attr="197" class="action">then when I see yours</a>, it looks like <a data-attr="198" class="action">this green color</a>, which is <a data-attr="199" class="action">the color of the pen</a>, makes up <a data-attr="200" class="action">very</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="201" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>A: I see. So I should use <a data-attr="202" class="action">the pen</a> as well.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="203" class="action">I’m. Okay.</a></p><p>A: <a data-attr="204" class="action">Circling</a> a lot helps. <a data-attr="205" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>B: Okay. Because it’s <a data-attr="206" class="action">nowhere to look</a>. <a data-attr="207" class="action">Okay</a>. Anyway, let’s <a data-attr="208" class="action">look at the next one</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="209" class="action">All right.</a></p><p>B: <a data-attr="210" class="action">Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>A: Yeah, we know of <a data-attr="211" class="action">that place</a>. Oh, <a data-attr="212" class="action">look</a>, there’s a lot of Hispanics in <a data-attr="213" class="action">Los Angeles</a>. It’s also reasonably <a data-attr="214" class="action">segregated</a>, <a data-attr="215" class="action">so I believe</a>.</p><p>B: This is <a data-attr="216" class="action">Monterey park</a>.</p><p>A: Which one can you <a data-attr="217" class="action">circle a lot</a>?</p><p>B: I’m <a data-attr="218" class="action">circling a</a>. Oh, I just can’t.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="219" class="action">See it</a> at all. I guess I make my <a data-attr="220" class="action">monitor</a>, my <a data-attr="221" class="action">screen bigger</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="222" class="action">All right, dear.</a> <a data-attr="223" class="action">Here</a>, I’m trying with the pen.</p><p>A: Okay. Now I see <a data-attr="224" class="action">south Texas down to East Los Angeles</a>. Yeah. <a data-attr="225" class="action">Monterey Park</a>. <a data-attr="226" class="action">I see it</a>. <a data-attr="227" class="action">Yes, that makes sense.</a></p><p>B: <a data-attr="228" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>A: But still, <a data-attr="229" class="action">San Gabriel</a>, that matches <a data-attr="230" class="action">what they expect</a>. Alhambra is probably <a data-attr="231" class="action">there</a> as well. Yeah. Just <a data-attr="232" class="action">above Monterey Park</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="233" class="action">Pasadena</a> is <a data-attr="234" class="action">surprisingly mixed</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="235" class="action">Yeah</a>. Mixed for <a data-attr="236" class="action">asian</a>, <a data-attr="237" class="action">Hispanic</a> and <a data-attr="238" class="action">white</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="239" class="action">Yes</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="240" class="action">As you would expect</a>. At least that matches my experience <a data-attr="241" class="action">there</a>. <a data-attr="242" class="action">Okay</a>. All right. I’m noticing <a data-attr="243" class="action">city centers are dense</a>. <a data-attr="244" class="action">Dense</a>, right. And dense. And usually <a data-attr="245" class="action">less segregated</a>.</p><p>B: I’m having trouble <a data-attr="246" class="action">seeing what’s going on</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="247" class="action">Over here</a>, I’m <a data-attr="248" class="action">seeing</a>, like, <a data-attr="249" class="action">green</a>, <a data-attr="250" class="action">red</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="251" class="action">Okay.</a></p><p>A: <a data-attr="252" class="action">Orange</a>, blue.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="253" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="254" class="action">Pretty much everything</a>, even.</p><p>B: So is <a data-attr="255" class="action">that</a> true for the other ones? Let’s <a data-attr="256" class="action">look at Chicago again</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="257" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>B: Oh, it’s not letting me <a data-attr="258" class="action">change</a> anymore.</p><p>A: I <a data-attr="259" class="action">click on it</a>, and it’s not changing. Interesting.</p><p>B: Oh, <a data-attr="260" class="action">there it goes</a>. Now I’m on <a data-attr="261" class="action">New York</a> again. I don’t know what <a data-attr="262" class="action">the city center</a> of is. I mean, I guess there’s <a data-attr="263" class="action">this area up here</a>, like, north of Manhattan.</p><p>A: Is it <a data-attr="264" class="action">the Upper east side</a>?</p><p>B: I don’t know anything about <a data-attr="265" class="action">New York</a>. <a data-attr="266" class="action">Let’s go back</a>. <a data-attr="267" class="action">The city center</a>. I don’t know what <a data-attr="268" class="action">the city center in Chicago</a> is, but it’s really dense right here along the.</p><p>A: Yeah, yeah. Okay. And I see that there is where there’s also <a data-attr="269" class="action">lack of segregation</a>.</p><p>B: But then <a data-attr="270" class="action">all the way up here</a>, there’s a little.</p><p>A: Yeah.</p><p>B: What other cities do we.</p><p>A: Interesting. It’s not changing for me again.</p><p>B: Me neither. I guess we just have to wait. There you go.</p><p>A: Boston might just take a while to load.</p><p>B: Yeah.</p><p>A: Boston looks similar in terms of density, is showing less segregation.</p><p>B: I feel like this is very zoomed out. Maybe I don’t know enough about Boston. I mean, I guess it’s got <a data-attr="271" class="action">this entire bay thing</a> going on.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="272" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>B: All right. And then what else do we. <a data-attr="273" class="action">City</a>.</p><p>A: Well, hello. <a data-attr="274" class="action">That matches my expectation as well</a>. All right.</p><p>B: What’s interesting is how dense it is by the university. I guess it’s because this is a <a data-attr="275" class="action">very zoomed out map</a>. So <a data-attr="276" class="action">this here</a> is <a data-attr="277" class="action">the university</a>.</p><p>A: I know where the university is. <a data-attr="278" class="action">Westbritter</a> is.</p><p>B: Okay. And then right around <a data-attr="279" class="action">the university</a> is downtown. So that’s where it gets <a data-attr="280" class="action">very dense</a>. But then there’s <a data-attr="281" class="action">this dividing line</a> between down. <a data-attr="282" class="action">Is that</a> <a data-attr="283" class="action">the river</a>? Okay. Then on <a data-attr="284" class="action">the west side</a> of <a data-attr="285" class="action">the river</a>, there’s <a data-attr="286" class="action">a little bit more</a>. A <a data-attr="287" class="action">little less</a> <a data-attr="288" class="action">segregation</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="289" class="action">There</a> you go. Yeah. And then <a data-attr="290" class="action">west of that</a>, of course, we got <a data-attr="291" class="action">the airport</a> and <a data-attr="292" class="action">the industrial area</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="293" class="action">Mines</a>. Yeah. Maybe <a data-attr="294" class="action">this one</a> should be zoomed in more as well.</p><p>A: It’s kind of nice to have pretty much all of <a data-attr="295" class="action">the metropolitan area</a> that we’re getting down.</p><p>B: People would know <a data-attr="296" class="action">that</a>. Where is <a data-attr="297" class="action">Provo</a> on <a data-attr="298" class="action">this map</a>? I think this is <a data-attr="299" class="action">Provo</a>. Or is that too <a data-attr="300" class="action">far north</a>, <a data-attr="301" class="action">south</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="302" class="action">Over behind</a>. <a data-attr="303" class="action">South of the map</a>. <a data-attr="304" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="305" class="action">Okay.</a></p><p>A: And <a data-attr="306" class="action">octane</a> is.</p><p>B: Then I think <a data-attr="307" class="action">the last map</a> is.</p><p>A: Is <a data-attr="308" class="action">that</a> related? Should be <a data-attr="309" class="action">a 6th map</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="310" class="action">Yeah, that’s confusing.</a> But <a data-attr="311" class="action">let’s see</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="312" class="action">Updating it</a>.</p><p>B: I know <a data-attr="313" class="action">this is not updating</a> for me either.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="314" class="action">Here</a>, one dot is 200 people on the Salt Lake city.</p><p>B: Oh, because of <a data-attr="315" class="action">the Zoom changes</a>.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="316" class="action">Yeah</a>. So it doesn’t match the instructions.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="317" class="action">Yeah</a>.</p><p>A: Not that that probably matters too much for interpreting <a data-attr="318" class="action">differences across cities</a>.</p><p>B: <a data-attr="319" class="action">There</a> you.</p><p>A: Ah, it’s <a data-attr="320" class="action">the US map</a>. <a data-attr="321" class="action">Here</a> you can also see where the population centers are.</p><p>B: It’s <a data-attr="322" class="action">a population</a>.</p><p>A: Yep. Except that you can see like <a data-attr="323" class="action">different</a>.</p><p>B: It’s literally <a data-attr="324" class="action">a population</a>.</p><p>A: Sure. But with <a data-attr="325" class="action">ethnic division or indications</a>, I should say a lot of <a data-attr="326" class="action">central area</a> looks very white.</p><p>B: Are you using your <a data-attr="327" class="action">point finger</a> at all?</p><p>A: <a data-attr="328" class="action">Nope.</a></p><p>B: The point is to use <a data-attr="329" class="action">the pointer</a>.</p><p>A: Okay. <a data-attr="330" class="action">Here</a> in the center of the US.</p><p>B: There’S nothing in <a data-attr="331" class="action">the center</a> of the.</p><p>A: <a data-attr="332" class="action">Okay</a>. <a data-attr="333" class="action">Okay</a>. So <a data-attr="334" class="action">here</a> on the midwest there’s a preponderance of white only. <a data-attr="335" class="action">Yes</a>.</p><p>B: I can’t see <a data-attr="336" class="action">your cursor</a> at all.</p><p>A: Because it matches <a data-attr="337" class="action">the color of the map</a>. Here, I’ll draw <a data-attr="338" class="action">here</a> in this sort of area.</p><p>B: Okay, wait, <a data-attr="339" class="action">exclude all the population</a>. This <a data-attr="340" class="action">area</a> is not the midwest. This is <a data-attr="341" class="action">the</a>.</p><p>A: Oh yeah, you’re from <a data-attr="342" class="action">Midwest</a>. But then I guess that’s not exactly true because <a data-attr="343" class="action">any population center</a> has a bit more.</p><p>B: Plus I think you can notice that <a data-attr="344" class="action">the south is more blue</a>.</p><p>A: Oh yeah, check that out.</p><p>B: That took a while to update. Yeah, like all of your circling of the little cities just popped out all of a sudden.</p><p>A: Oh, interesting. So there’s some language. Yeah, I should erase them all because I’ve littered them out. What does the pointer do? Can you move things? I’m just curious now, getting distracted. Okay, so I get the move icon. When I put the pointer icon over the circle that I just drew it. Okay. Try to drag it. Doesn’t do anything. Now I saw that we have some problems. Okay, so now we can stop recording and do a second session. I think maybe the recording gets too much.</p><p>B: Okay, so I’m going to click record and stop recording.</p></article>
